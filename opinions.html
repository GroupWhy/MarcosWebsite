						<p class="text">The rule of Marcos was indeeed a controversial event. His declaration of Martial Law led to many mishaps such as loss of one's rights and numerous deaths of innocent people. But his cruelty also led to a fiery and determined spirit of Filipinos. They fight and argue to avoid leaders who are relatives of Marcos to serve in the government, because from history, this family is known to be very corrupt. Ferdinand Marcos will never be a hero to me and shall never be considered as one.<br>#NeverAgain</p>

					<p class="text">Absolute power can make a person reveal their innermost desires. Presented with a tempting oppurtunity to rule a developing nation, Marcos did not hesitate to grab the chance and seize the position as president of the Philippines. Yielding authority and influence, an unjust and tyrrannical rule was born and forged from the depths Marcos' intriguing mind.</p>

					<p class="text">Marcos is the worst president the Philippines ever had. He was the first president to implement martial law in the Philippines. In his first term, he was considered as the best president, he made our country's economic status very high. But in his second term, he was being greedy and wanted to control everything and then he implemented martial law.</p>

					<p class="text">Marcos was, without a doubt, one of the most infamous and brutal dictators of the world had ever seen. He was ruthless and iron-willed, and is accountable for the deaths and disappearances of thousands of his former political enemies and political dissidents of his time. However, his existence has strengthened the Filipino people's drive to maintain their freedoms and responsibilities so as to never be under a dictator's yoke ever again.</p>

					<p class="text">Most of us think that Marcos is evil and abusive especially when it comes to the Martial Law. People always have their own bad side. Marcos just chose to be that way in order to protect the country. Because of his intelligence, he thinks that leading the country with his ideology is right for the people. Everyone needs discipline.</p>

					<p class="text">No to the Marcoses ever again! People should learn from their past mistakes. An apology for the death of thousands of innocent civillians, stolen huge sum of money, and fall of the Philippines isn't enough. Filipinos shall open their eyes and realize that there are lots of people similar to the Marcoses. Each and everyone shall be wise enough to not trust manipulative people.</p>
