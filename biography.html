		<h1> Marcos and his Martial Law Atrocities </h1>
		<div class="titles"> EARLY LIFE </div>
			<p> On the 11th day of September 1917, a school teacher, Josefa Edralin, gave birth to a baby boy in the village of Sarrat, on the island of Luzon, Philippines. This boy was named Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos. He grew up in a privileged environment. Little did we know, that in this man’s future years, he would be one of the greatest powerful leaders in the Philippine history. 
				His supposed father, Mariano Marcos was a teacher and later, a two-term congressman. Accused of collaboration with the Japanese, he was later tied to four water buffalo and split into four carcasses with his limbs ripped off from the core of his body. 
				Marcos excelled at school in Manila, with his tuition being paid by the help of his “godfather”, Ferdinand Chua, a well-connected judge who also functioned as Marco's fairy godfather, bestowing the future president a chance to gain his freedom and escape the deep pits of imprisonment. He had a big interest in Martial Arts such as boxing, and was also actively participating in practicing shooting with a .22 caliber pistol. During the 1930s, the young man studied law at the University of the Philippines, outside Manila. His skills came in handy because in 1935, the younger Marcos assassinated Nalundasan after the latter beat his father in a congressional election. He was 18 years old at the time. Marcos was later arrested and even though he was living in a prison cell, he continued his studies and was able to pass the bar exam with flying colors.

		<div class="titles"> CAREER </div>
			<p> When Ferdinand Marcos was practicing law, it was also when World War II began. He soon joined the Filipino Army, and fought as a combat intelligence officer against the Japanese. He allegedly even survived the Bataan Death March, a week-long trek that killed about 25% of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces in the Far East) POWs in Luzon.
				During the conflict however, he was reported to have spent time on the Axis and Allied sides of the Philippine theatre of war. His claims of establishing a guerilla group, “Ang Mga Maharlika”, were later confirmed to be false. Nonetheless, he would emerge from the war a hero, with numerous (questionable) medals and awards from the United States Army.
				In the postwar years, Marcos served not just as a special assistant to the first president of the newly-independent Republic of the Philippines, Manuel Roxas, he also used his knowledge of the law, to sue for Filipino USAFFE veterans seeking back pay, or unpaid wages. He was also a member of the President’s Liberal Party in the Senate during 1936 to 1965. In 1948, Marcos supposed wartime career was published in four articles, causing a boom in his popularity. After campaigning by using promises on veteran's bonuses, among other things, he was promptly voted in the House of Representatives, with over 70 percent of the vote.
				In 1965, he campaigned against incumbent president Diosdado Macapagal who had promised Marcos that he will step aside after one term, but then reneged and ran again for the role of the president. Marcos then used his popularity and wealth, as well as political skills in gaining the highest government post in the nation.

		<div class="titles"> MARRIAGE </div>
			<p> That was May 01, 1954 at the Pro Cathedral of San Miguel in Manila when the marriage of Ferdinand Marcos and a former beauty queen, Imelda Marcos, happened. They were first married in a civil ceremony in Baguio City but later on decided to have another wedding, which is a church wedding (religious marriage).
				Marcos won the heart of Imelda in a blistering 11 days despite their differing political views. Marcos was a Liberal and an Ilocano while Imelda was a Nacionalista by family tradition and a Waray-waray.
				The principal sponsor for their wedding was Marcos' old employer, the former president Ramon Magsaysay. There were about 3000 invited officials of Manila and social elites for the breakfast reception in the Malacañang Palace.
				The media celebrated with their wedding, publicizing it as the "Wedding of the Year." Marcos had his house in San Juan renovated after the marriage. And to offer as much time for his family, he added a wing for his law office.

		<div class="titles"> EXILE AND DEATH </div>
			<p> Marcos called for a new election for 1986 against Corazon Aquino, the wife of Benigno. Marcos claimed a 1.6 million vote victory, but observers in the community found a 800,000 win by Aquino. After the People Power Revolution, Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii under protection from the United States. The Marcoses had laundered billions of dollars from the Philippines, as well as in Switzerland. Imelda famously left over 2,500 pairs of shoes in her closet when she fled Manila. They were later put on trial for corruption, embezzlement, and graft among others. Both were later acquitted.
				Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos, Sr. later died of multiple organ failure on September 28, 1989. He left behind a reputation as one of the most corrupt and ruthless leaders in modern Asia.
