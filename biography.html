			<h2 class="topic">EARLY LIFE</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">September 21, 2016, 44 years ago, in 1972, the President of the Republic of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos declared Proclamation No. 1081, the massive event that brought drastic changes and effects to the whole nation that is the topic of arguments and debates today.
				Why did he declare Martial Law? To the anti-Marcos elements, it was due to his immense greed for power and wealth. Nothing more, nothing less. But was that really the true reason why he did so? If you can and research every single corner of resources available, you might find out why and reach to a conclusion. Marcos declared Martial Law because of Ninoy Aquino. Ninoy Aquino was the new political superstar of that time. He was conceived to be the next President of the Philippines. But Ninoy was perceived and thought to be a communist, or at least sympathetic to the communist movement that was leading the masses’ mindset to engulf the nation.
				The constitutional option for Marcos had run out. The explosive bribing scandal that exposed his attempts to influence the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1972 to allow him to run again killed that alternative. It was at the height of the communist movement’s popularity. For a society beset by severe social inequity and grinding poverty like the Philippines, communism certainly provided a stark alternative, with its own powerful mass appeal, to challenge the unjust status quo. In fact, Southeast Asia then, in particular Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, was fast being run over by the Communists, due to the huge support of the people. The US, the world leader of the anti-communist bloc, was understandably distraught. The thought and prospect that Ninoy Aquino as president of one of its closest allies was another problem to work with. So Washington must have talked and persuaded Marcos to stay on as did other leaders, especially the leaders of the Church, who were fearful of the communists, assuring him of their support. Marcos must have also estimated that if he stepped down indeed, Washington, would instigate a coup instead and install a military junta if only to stall and delay the inevitable running of Ninoy Aquino presidency. Indeed, if his military background be any guide, Marcos himself must have shared the same apprehensions.
				So why not Martial law, the one last option left? He had nothing to lose. In fact, great opportunities beckoned.

			<h2 class="topic">CAREER</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">When Ferdinand Marcos was practicing law, it was also when World War II began. He soon joined the Filipino Army, and fought as a combat intelligence officer against the Japanese. He allegedly even survived the Bataan Death March, a week-long trek that killed about 25% of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces in the Far East) POWs in Luzon.
				During the conflict however, he was reported to have spent time on the Axis and Allied sides of the Philippine theatre of war. His claims of establishing a guerilla group, “Ang Mga Maharlika”, were later confirmed to be false. Nonetheless, he would emerge from the war a hero, with numerous (questionable) medals and awards from the United States Army.
				In the postwar years, Marcos served not just as a special assistant to the first president of the newly-independent Republic of the Philippines, Manuel Roxas, he also used his knowledge of the law, to sue for Filipino USAFFE veterans seeking back pay, or unpaid wages. He was also a member of the President’s Liberal Party in the Senate during 1936 to 1965. In 1948, Marcos supposed wartime career was published in four articles, causing a boom in his popularity. After campaigning by using promises on veteran's bonuses, among other things, he was promptly voted in the House of Representatives, with over 70 percent of the vote.
				In 1965, he campaigned against incumbent president Diosdado Macapagal who had promised Marcos that he will step aside after one term, but then reneged and ran again for the role of the president. Marcos then used his popularity and wealth, as well as political skills in gaining the highest government post in the nation.

			<h2 class="topic">MARRIAGE</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">That was May 01, 1954 at the Pro Cathedral of San Miguel in Manila when the marriage of Ferdinand Marcos and a former beauty queen, Imelda Marcos, happened. They were first married in a civil ceremony in Baguio City but later on decided to have another wedding, which is a church wedding (religious marriage).
				Marcos won the heart of Imelda in a blistering 11 days despite their differing political views. Marcos was a Liberal and an Ilocano while Imelda was a Nacionalista by family tradition and a Waray-waray.
				The principal sponsor for their wedding was Marcos' old employer, the former president Ramon Magsaysay. There were about 3000 invited officials of Manila and social elites for the breakfast reception in the Malacañang Palace.
				The media celebrated with their wedding, publicizing it as the "Wedding of the Year." Marcos had his house in San Juan renovated after the marriage. And to offer as much time for his family, he added a wing for his law office.

			<h2 class="topic">EXILE AND DEATH</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Marcos called for a new election for 1986 against Corazon Aquino, the wife of Benigno. Marcos claimed a 1.6 million vote victory, but observers in the community found a 800,000 win by Aquino. After the People Power Revolution, Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii under protection from the United States. The Marcoses had laundered billions of dollars from the Philippines, as well as in Switzerland. Imelda famously left over 2,500 pairs of shoes in her closet when she fled Manila. They were later put on trial for corruption, embezzlement, and graft among others. Both were later acquitted.
				Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos, Sr. later died of multiple organ failure on September 28, 1989. He left behind a reputation as one of the most corrupt and ruthless leaders in modern Asia.
