		<h1> Marcos and his Martial Law Atrocities </h1>
		<div class="titles"> EARLY LIFE </div>
			<p> On the 11th day of September 1917, a school teacher, Josefa Edralin, gave birth to a baby boy in the village of Sarrat, on the island of Luzon, Philippines. This boy was named Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos. He grew up in a privileged environment. Little did we know, that in this man’s future years, he would be one of the greatest powerful leaders in the Philippine history. 
				His supposed father, Mariano Marcos was a teacher and later, a two-term congressman. Accused of collaboration with the Japanese, he was later tied to four water buffalo and split into four carcasses with his limbs ripped off from the core of his body. 
				Marcos excelled at school in Manila, with his tuition being paid by the help of his “godfather”, Ferdinand Chua, a well-connected judge who also functioned as Marco's fairy godfather, bestowing the future president a chance to gain his freedom and escape the deep pits of imprisonment. He had a big interest in Martial Arts such as boxing, and was also actively participating in practicing shooting with a .22 caliber pistol. During the 1930s, the young man studied law at the University of the Philippines, outside Manila. His skills came in handy because in 1935, the younger Marcos assassinated Nalundasan after the latter beat his father in a congressional election. He was 18 years old at the time. Marcos was later arrested and even though he was living in a prison cell, he continued his studies and was able to pass the bar exam with flying colors.
