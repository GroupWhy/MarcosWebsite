			<h2 class="topic">Controversies</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">September 21, 2016, 44 years ago, in 1972, the President of the Republic of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos declared Proclamation No. 1081, the massive event that brought drastic changes and effects to the whole nation that is the topic of arguments and debates today.
				Why did he declare Martial Law? To the anti-Marcos elements, it was due to his immense greed for power and wealth. Nothing more, nothing less. But was that really the true reason why he did so? If you can and research every single corner of resources available, you might find out why and reach to a conclusion. Marcos declared Martial Law because of Ninoy Aquino. Ninoy Aquino was the new political superstar of that time. He was conceived to be the next President of the Philippines. But Ninoy was perceived and thought to be a communist, or at least sympathetic to the communist movement that was leading the masses’ mindset to engulf the nation.
				The constitutional option for Marcos had run out. The explosive bribing scandal that exposed his attempts to influence the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1972 to allow him to run again killed that alternative. It was at the height of the communist movement’s popularity. For a society beset by severe social inequity and grinding poverty like the Philippines, communism certainly provided a stark alternative, with its own powerful mass appeal, to challenge the unjust status quo. In fact, Southeast Asia then, in particular Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, was fast being run over by the Communists, due to the huge support of the people. The US, the world leader of the anti-communist bloc, was understandably distraught. The thought and prospect that Ninoy Aquino as president of one of its closest allies was another problem to work with. So Washington must have talked and persuaded Marcos to stay on as did other leaders, especially the leaders of the Church, who were fearful of the communists, assuring him of their support. Marcos must have also estimated that if he stepped down indeed, Washington, would instigate a coup instead and install a military junta if only to stall and delay the inevitable running of Ninoy Aquino presidency. Indeed, if his military background be any guide, Marcos himself must have shared the same apprehensions.
				So why not Martial law, the one last option left? He had nothing to lose. In fact, great opportunities beckoned.

			<h2 class="topic">Effects</h2>
			<p class="paragraph"> After Marcos started to wantonly pour out his resources and money on his campaign to be reelected, Philippines suffered a terrible crisis both in economy and finance in the early 1970's. 
				With the Philippine government under constant pressure to pay the US$ 2.3 billion debt, they devised a plan to arrange a US$27.5 million credit with the International Monetary Fund which resulted to depreciating the value of the Philippine peso to P6.40 with the US dollar. With the Philippine government unable to take care of the problems on its own, they acquiesced to the dictates of the International Monetary Fund. This went on for the following years to come.
				In September 1972, Marcos declared Martial Law, justifying that the country was under threat from revolutions. He then amassed a squad of proprietors, and started making use of presiden-tial edicts to let them yield monopoly positions, and began furrowing resources to himself and his accomplices, leading to it being coined as “crony capitalism”.
				Initially, the “New Society”, as proposed by Marcos was widely given praise by the business in-dustry. Investments on foreign soil were done, several facilities and resources were made, and the Philippines projected itself to the world economy as a nation of industrial peace.
				By 1976, the Philippines was included in the Top 100 consignees of loans from the World Bank. 
				It's scale of payments problem was solved and augmentation expedited, at least for a limited amount of time.
				Internal problems surfaced, particularly in result of the of the rapidly increasing uncalculated and inexperienced management of the crony organizations. A scandal occurred in January of 1981 where a businessman departed the country with the debts estimating to a P700 million. The increase and production rate of the nation's Gross National Product razed dangerously, and then resulted to the economic afflictions and infirmity of the Philippines. In 1980, an abrupt change occurred in the policies of the nation's economy, with the Philippine government agree-ing to reduce the moderate level and diffusion and distribution of tariff rates. The forgoing re-sult was growing debt-service payments.
				It was in this encompassment in August of 1983 that President Marcos' first and foremost critic, former Senator Benigno Aquino, has returned from banishment and was horribly assassinated. The nation was then thrown into an economic and political chaos that had resulted, in the Feb-ruary of 1986, in the disruption and cease of Marcos' twenty-one year rule and his depart from the Philippines. In the meantime, debt repayment had ended. Real Gross National Product fell more than 11 percent before ascending back up in 1986.
				The law had a major and long-lasting effect on the country's social system, somehow creating a divide in the opinions of the masses and a constantly changing projection of the country's economy.
